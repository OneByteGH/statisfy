## FAQ

#### What's the ETA?

I don't know. I am a student as well so it depends on my school and tests.

#### Is my data safe with you?
Well it is, but that's not enough for you to trust me. So, if you know how JSONs work, I have made it so even if you only submit your track data (which you get from spotify), it will still work, so you don't have to submit the other data like personal details etc.
I am going to make  a tool for this which will remove that for you in a different repo later as well.
#### Is this completely free?

Heck yea, everything
